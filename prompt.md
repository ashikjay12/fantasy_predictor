I want you to answer only in complete sentences and prose unless otherwise stated. Has {Player} being playing well? What does his player statistics look like? What team does he play for? Also, take a look at the next fixtures. Paste the next fixtures in a tabular format, include times and dates in this format: DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM. Then, briefly comment on how the next 5 fixtures will be for the player. Check the head to head scores to evaluate how difficult each of the fixtures will be. Mention past head to head scores in your findings. Also tabulate some of the results from previous head to head fixtures. For each team, comment on how difficult it will be, then show the previous scores. When pasting the head to head scores, ensure there are no duplicates.

For each team, you MUST reference the form of each team, and fetch the last 5 matches for a team to analyse it's form.
